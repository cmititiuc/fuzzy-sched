this is me trying to figure out how to deploy ophect.me again

log in to digital ocean

click on my droplet and click on access, hoping there's a place where I can add
my ssh key

don't see anything like that

ssh deployer@ophect.me

then the password I remember

doesn't work

ssh deploy@ophect.me

nope

ssh root@ophect.me

no luck

ssh m@ophect.me

a-ha!

ls /home/

dokku  m

hmmm, I don't remember ever loggin in as dokku@ophect.me.  i don't know what I
remembering, then, why I was trying deployer@ophect.me

sudo apt-get update

log out and log back in

88 packages can be updated.
51 updates are security updates.

New release '16.04.1 LTS' available.
Run 'do-release-upgrade' to upgrade to it.

i'm scared, but fuck it, let's try it

do-release-upgrade

something goes wrong, and it terminates before it even begins
something about not having apt installed

at least try to get some security updates

sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo shutdown -r now

reconnect

delete the old ssh key from /home/dokku/ssh/authorized_keys

log out

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "m@ophect.me"

cat id_rsa.pub | ssh m@ophect.me "sudo sshcommand acl-add dokku"

sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified

hmmm

ssh-copy-id m@ophect.me

ssh m@ophect.me

logs me in without a password

copy key from ~/.ssh/authorized_keys to /home/dokku/.ssh/authorized_keys

log out

ssh dokku@ophect.me

logs me in without a password

add my key to my github account (just copy contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)

git clone my ophect repo (fuzzy-sched)

git clone git@github.com:cmititiuc/fuzzy-sched.git

cd fuzzy-sched

git remote add dokku dokku@ophect.me:ophect.me

git push dokku master

Everything up-to-date

nice!
