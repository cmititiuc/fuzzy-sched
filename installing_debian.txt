This is me trying to install Debian on my lenovo t450

I plug in the USB drive with my image of Debian on it
Restart
Press Enter to interrupt boot sequence
F12 to boot from a temporary device
Choose `USB HDD: SanDisk Cruzer Glide` from menu
Choose graphical install
Discover that my mousepad doesn't work
The little nub works, tho!
Insert USB with missing drivers
Not the right drivers or something cuz it's not working
firmware-iwlwifi_0.43_all.deb this one seems to be the right one
https://packages.debian.org/jessie/all/firmware-iwlwifi/download
I tried the USB with the drivers in different ports but they aren't being read
Then I unplug the USB with the OS image on it, and plug the drivers USB into that port
It reads it ok now and installs the drivers

Ok, after a few failed attempts at swapping out USBs and not getting them read, I restarted the install with both USBs plugged in from the start
Which seems to be working

Install was completed

good idea or bad, it works.  windows are no longer laggy
